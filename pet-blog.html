    <h3>Getting them was a huge mistake.</h3>

    <p>
      I have two cats named london and earl. I got them at the pound. They may previously had lived in a trash can. They're garbage cats
    </p>
    <p>
      The dumbest one is <strong>Earl</strong> This is what earl does all day<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tqxgA6q0jE"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SHcPOSFjaWw/hqdefault.jpg" alt="dumb earl sleeping" /></a>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>He sleeps all day</li>
      <li>He eats out of the garbage can <img src="http://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/dce07b8c-1154/k2-_00695cab-70d0-4db9-93fc-d4bdde8b7586.v1.jpg" alt="hes garbage" /></li>

      <li>In the garbage can</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The less dumb one is <strong>London</strong>. These are her favorite things to do
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stare at the wall for hours</li>
      <li>Eat small objects that will cause harm</li>
      <li>Make weird noises all day long</li>
    </ul>
