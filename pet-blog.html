    <h1>I habe two cats</h1>
    <h2>They're the worst</h2>
    <h3>Getting them was the worst mistake of my life.</h3>
    
    <p>
      I have two cats named london and earl. I got them at the pound. They may previously had lived in a trash can. They're garbage cats
    </p>
    <p>
      The dumbest one is Earl. This is what earl does all day
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>He sleeps all day</li>
      <li>He eats out of the garbage can</li>
      <li>He destroys all electrical cords</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Here are his favorite places to sleep in order
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>on my face</li>
      <li>on my computer</li>
      <li>In the garbage can</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The less dumb one is London. These are her favorite things to do
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stare at the wall for hours</li>
      <li>Eat small objects that will cause harm</li>
      <li>Make weird noises all day long</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You may ask "why do you keep such terrible pets?" My Answer:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I dont really know. I just do</li>
    </ul>
